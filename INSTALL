Mail::IMAPClient Installation

The Mail::IMAPClient is written entirely in Perl, so it should install on any version of Perl. 
The installation is standard:

	0) cd to installation directory
	1) perl Makefile.PL		(and reply to the prompt(s))
	2) make					(optional)
	3) make test 				(optional)
	4) make install 				

The 'make install' will do step 2 ('make') if you haven't done it already. Currently the test script
is lame (although not as lame as in the last release!) but I hope to incorporate more thorough testing 
in a future version. You should at least try it and let me know if your tests fail. 

Now go and write IMAP clients.
