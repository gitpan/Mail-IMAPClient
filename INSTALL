Mail::IMAPClient Installation

The Mail::IMAPClient is written entirely in Perl, so it should install on any version of Perl. 
The installation is standard:

	0) cd to installation directory
	1) perl Makefile.PL		(and reply to the prompt(s))
	2) make					(optional)
	3) make test 				(optional)
	4) make install 				

The 'make install' will do step 2 ('make') if you haven't done it already. Currently the test script
is lame (although not as lame as in the last release!) but I hope to incorporate more thorough testing 
in a future version. You should at least try it and let me know if your tests fail. 

Version 1.0 changed the installation script so that it reuses the parameter file for test.pl if it
finds one. Installation can be run in the background if the .test file exists. Touching it is good 
enough to prevent prompts; having a correctly formatted version (as shown in .test_template) 
is even better, as it will allow you to do a thorough 'make test'. Invalid date in .test (either 
from precreating it or from responding inaccurately to prompts) will cause 'make test' to report
'not ok' results but won't break anything important (like the IMAPClient.pm file).

If you don't have a .test file in your installation directory then you will have to answer at 
least one prompt. If you do have a .test file, and you run 'make clean', then you won't have a
.test file anymore, so take precautions. 

Now go and write IMAP clients.
