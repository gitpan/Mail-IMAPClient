Mail::IMAPClient Installation

The Mail::IMAPClient is written entirely in Perl, so it should install on any version of Perl. 
The installation is standard:

	0) cd to installation directory
	1) perl Makefile.PL
	2) make					(optional)
	3) make test 				(optional)
	4) make install 				

The 'make install' will do step 2 ('make') if you haven't done it already. Currently the test script
is lame but I hope to incorporate more thorough testing in a future version.
