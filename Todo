The following is a list of some items that I hope to include in a future release:

- Currently a number of IMAP Client commands are implemented using the 'default method', which
is an AUTOLOAD hack. I'd like to reduce that if possible to a bare minimum.

- I'd like to provide more perlish interfaces, such as the folders method which returns an array
or a pointer to an array of folder names and which has no direct IMAP counterpart. For example,
a 'since' method could be written to implement the SEARCH SINCE syntax. It would be nice if 
eventually you didn't have to reference RFC2060 to use this module.

- I'd like to see this module certified for more OS's and more IMAP servers. This is (hopefully) 
just a matter of testing; the code should already be compatible with the IMAP servers that are out
there and with any OS that allows the IO::Socket module to work.

- Support for older/other versions of IMAP. Currently only RFC2060 is explicitly supported, although
thanks to the 'default method' (implemented via and AUTOLOAD hack) virtually any IMAP command is 
supported, even proprietary commands, X- extensions, and so forth. But not necessarily other 
authentication mechanisms... :-(

- Support for other authentication mechanisms, such as NTLM.

- Better support for the UID Imap Client command.
