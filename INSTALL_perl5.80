Please let me know if you have any problems under perl 5.8.x.

I do know of one issue under perl 5.8.0. If you are installing from
a work directory that contains a double colon in one of the 
component subdirectory names then some of the tests may fail.
For example, I do my development work from a subdirectory that
has "Mail::IMAPClient" in the path, and 'make test' fails for 
the subcomponents of Mail::IMAPClient from that path; the test
harness is unable to locate the ../lib/blib subdirectory and so
cannot load the .pm file. If I install from a different directory 
without "::"'s then everything tests okay.

A work around is to not install from a subdirectory with "::".

An alternative work around is to do 'make install' before 'make test'. 
This gets around the problem by placing a copy of the necessary files 
in your installation directories, so that even though 'make test' 
cannot find ../blib/lib, it can find the necessary .pm files in your 
(production!) installation libraries so the tests will still succeed.
