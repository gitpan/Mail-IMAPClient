Revision history for Perl extension IMAPClient.

Changes in version 1.04
-----------------------

Fixed situation in which servers that include the "<tag> <COMMAND> OK\r\n" line
as part of a literal (i.e. text delivered via {<length>}\r\n<length> bytes\r\n)
caused the module to hang. This situation is pretty rare; I've only run across
one server that does it (UW-IMAP). I'm sure it's a bug; I'm not sure whose. ;-}
Many thanks to Thomas Stromberg for 1) pointing out this bug and 2) providing 
me with facilities to find and fix it!

Fixed potential bug in I/O engine that could cause module to hang when reading 
a literal if the first read did not capture the entire literal.

Cleaned up some unnecessary runtime warnings when a script is executed with 
the -w switch.

Added new tests to 'make test'. I just can't keep my hands off it! ;-)

Enhanced the append method and several tests in 'make test' to be more widely
compatible. Successfully tested on UW-IMAP, Cyrus v1.5.19, Netscape Messenger 
4.1, and Netscape Messenger v3.6. If you know of others please add them to 
the list! 

Fixed a bug in the separator method (new in 1.03) that caused it to fail if
'inbox' was specified in lowercase characters as the method's argument. 

Added a new example, imap_to_mbox.pl, contributed by Thomas Stromberg. This 
example converts a user's IMAP folders on an IMAP server into mbox format. 

Changes in version 1.03
-----------------------
Reworked several methods to support double-quote characters within folder 
names. This was kind of hard. This has been successfully tested with create, 
delete, select, and folders, to name the ones that come to mind.

Reworked the undocumented method that reads the socket to accept and handle
more gracefully lines ending in {nnn}\r\n ( where nnn is a number of 
characters to read). This seems to be part of the IMAP protocol although I 
am at a total loss as to where it's explained, other than a brief description 
of a "literal's" bnf syntax, which hardly counts. 

Added separator object method, which returns the separator character in use 
by the current server. 

Added is_parent method, which returns 1, 0, or undef depending on whether a 
folder has children, has no children, or is not permitted to have children.

Added tests to 'make test' to test new function. Also changed 'make test' to 
support IMAP systems that allow folders to be created only in the user's INBOX 
(which is the exact opposite of what my IMAP server allows...oh, well).

Fixed a bug that caused search to return an array of one undef'ed element 
rather than undef if there were no hits.


Changes in version 1.02
-----------------------
Fixed bugs in search and folders methods. 

Fixed bug in new method that ignored Clear => 0 when specified as arguments to 
new.

Changes in version 1.01
-----------------------
Fixed a bug in test.pl that caused tests to fail if the extended tests were not used.

Added method 'parse_headers' to parse the header fields of a message in the 
IMAP store into a perl data structure.

Changes in version 1.00
-----------------------
Made cosmetic changes to documentation.

Fixed a bug introduced into the 'folders' method in .99.

Changed 'new' method so that it returns undef if an implicit connection or 
login is attempted but fails. Previous releases returned a Mail::IMAPClient 
object that was not connected or not logged in, depending on what failed.

Changed installation script so that it reuses the parameter file for test.pl 
if it finds one. Installation can be run in the background if the .test file 
exists. Touching it is good enough to prevent prompts; having a correctly 
formatted version (as described in .test_template) is even better, as it will 
allow you to do a thorough 'make test'.

Changes in version .99 
----------------------
Added the Rfc822_date class method to create RFC822-compliant date fields in 
messages being appended with the append method.

Added the recent, seen, and unseen methods to return an array of sequence 
numbers from a SEARCH RECENT, SEARCH SEEN, or SEARCH UNSEEN method call. 
These methods are shortcuts to $imap->search("RECENT"), etc. 

Added the recent_count method to return the number of RECENT messages in a 
folder. Contributed by Rob Deker.

Added 'use strict' compliance, courtesy of Mihai Ibanescu.

Fixed a bug in the search method that resulted in a list with one empty member 
being returned if a search had no hits. The search method now returns undef 
if there are no hits.

Added 'authenticate' method to provide very crude support for the IMAP 
AUTHENTICATE command. The previous release didn't support AUTHENTICATE at all, 
unless you used very low-level (and undocumented) methods. With the 
'authenticate' method, the programmer still has to figure out how to 
respond to the server's challenge. I hope to make it friendlier in the 
next release. Or maybe the one after that. This method is at least a start, 
albeit a pretty much untested one.

Added Rfc822_date class method to facilitate creation of "Date:" header 
field when creating text for the "append" method, although the method may 
come in handy whenever you're creating a Date: header, even if it's not 
in conjuction with an IMAP session.

Added more tests, which will optionally run at 'make test' time, provided all 
the necessary data (like username, hostname, password for testing an IMAP 
session) are available.
