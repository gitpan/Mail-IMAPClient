Changes in version .99 
----------------------
Added the Rfc822_date class method to create RFC822-compliant date fields in messages 
being appended with the append method.

Added the recent, seen, and unseen methods to return an array of sequence numbers from a 
SEARCH RECENT, SEARCH SEEN, or SEARCH UNSEEN method call. These methods are shortcuts to
$imap->search("RECENT"), etc. 

Added the recent_count method to return the number of RECENT messages in a folder. Contributed
by Rob Deker.

Added 'use strict' compliance, courtesy of Mihai Ibanescu.

Fixed a bug in the search method that resulted in a list with one empty member being returned if
a search had no hits. The search method now returns undef if there are no hits.

Added 'authenticate' method to provide very crude support for the IMAP AUTHENTICATE command. The previous
release didn't support AUTHENTICATE at all, unless you used very low-level (and undocumented) methods. 
With the 'authenticate' method, the programmer still has to figure out how to respond to the server's 
challenge. I hope to make it friendlier in the next release. Or maybe the one after that. This method
is at least a start, albeit a pretty much untested one.

Added Rfc822_date class method to facilitate creation of "Date:" header field when creating text for
the "append" method, although the method may come in handy whenever you're creating a Date: header,
even if it's not in conjuction with an IMAP session.

Added more tests, which will optionally run at 'make test' time, provided all the necessary data
(like username, hostname, password for testing an IMAP session) are available.
